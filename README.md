# SHIT-the-man
A 2D multiplayer shooter game developed using GLUT as a course assignment for "Fundamentals of Computer Programming" in my 1st Semester of Bachelor's.

#### Objective of the game:
In this 2 player game, P1 is supposed to control the man on the ground and P2 controls the bird. The objective of P1 is to shoot down the bird while the objective of P2 is to sh*t  on the man. Each hit gives 1 score and first player to 5 score wins.

###### The code has massive room for improvements (both to organization and to performance), as it was written in my first few months of coding practice.

To run the game, clone the project and compile it using Visual Studio (tested against VS2015 and VS2019).
